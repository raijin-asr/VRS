---------------------------VRS(Vehicle Rental System)-----------------------------------
 READ THIS FIRST:
 1. First you must put this Full Folder named "VRS" in E: Disk
 2. Then Run "Corona VRS.exe" to launch the system(VRS) using Dev C/C++ Compiler only for better result
 3. If you want to edit coding part, run "Corona VRS.cpp" in Dev C/C++
 4. Don't run in Turbo C++ because it may not work properly
